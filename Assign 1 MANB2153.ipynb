    "      1. Machine Learning is a category of an algorithm that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic tenet of machine learning is building algorithms that can receive input data and use the statistical analysis to predict an output as new data made available (Margaret Rouse, https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/machine-learning-ML, May 2018).\n",
    "      \n",
    "      2. Machine Learning is any technology that uses algorithms to try to create repeatable results. It facilitates the continuous advancement of computing through exposure to new scenarios, testing and adaptation while employing pattern and trend detection for imrpoved decisions in subsequent situations (https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8181/machine-learning.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      3. Machine Learning is a field of study that allow computers learn and adapt to new data without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel, 1959).\n",
